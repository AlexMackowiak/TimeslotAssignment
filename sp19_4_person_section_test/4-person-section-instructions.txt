4 students, 1 hour sections:

Approach 1:
In order to double the number of time slots from 2 hour Doodle results:
1. Double every student preference value by copying it to the left
2. Double every mod preference value by copying it to the left
3. Add 1 to every mod max section value
4. Double the number of section time room entries
5. Change min in section to 3 and max in section to 4

The above approach however runs significant risk of being computationally infeasible

Approach 2 without doubling time slots:
1. Add 1 to every mod max section value
2. Allow 2 mods per 2-hour section (Double the number of rooms in the time constraint)
3. Set min in section to 3 and max in section to 4

Having tried both, approach 2 tends to be way more computationally feasible
