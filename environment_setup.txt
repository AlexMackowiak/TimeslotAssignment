# Before working on this repository, you probably want to set up a local python virtual environment:
# 1. Run the "venv" python module to create the ".venv" virtual environment directory
# 2. Enter the virtual environment with the "activate" bash file
# 3. Ensure your virtual environment pip version is up to date to locate the necessary packages
# 4. Have pip collect all the required packages for the virtual 
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# To exit the virtual environment and go back to your default python installation and installed packages
deactivate

# If you add a required package to this repository, save it for others with the following:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
git add requirements.txt, commit, etc.
